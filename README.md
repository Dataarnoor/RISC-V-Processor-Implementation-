# RISC-V-Processor-Implementation-
This repository contains a RISC-V processor implementation in Verilog, featuring both sequential and pipelined architectures. It includes complete hazard handling mechanisms such as data forwarding and pipeline stalls. The project provides a functional and optimized processor design for executing RIbolSC-V instructions efficiently.
